# Novalabs Studio

A Roblox based Studio formed during the summer of 2025, with an official debut to be determined.
Novalabs prioritizes innovation and enjoyment over everything else, intending to put gameplay at the forefront of all projects.

While currently in development, there are two projects being designed.

As a studio, we want to offer a positive environment for developers and other staff members to flourish, sharpen their skills, and live comfortably while providing a valuable service for the community.
