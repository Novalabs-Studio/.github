# Novalabs Studio

A Roblox based Studio formed during the summer of 2025, with an official debut to be determined.
Novalabs prioritizes innovation and enjoyment over everything else, intending to put gameplay at the forefront of all projects.

While currently in development, there are three projects being built bit by bit:
- Forge | A game focused on exploring and harvesting various resources in order to create weapons and armor
- Planet Chasers | A roguelike game following a space force from Earth exploring various extra-solar planets in order to log and harvest items.
- Pit Fighters | A MOBA game set in various arenas outside of reality, connecting characters from various eras for the sole sake of fighting it out for glory.

As a studio, we want to offer a positive environment for developers and other staff members to flourish, sharpen their skills, and live comfortably while providing a valuable service for the community.
